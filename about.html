        <p> I'm currently a Business Management major in West Hills College Lemoore. I'm also hoping
            to get my Web Development Certification. I choose business because I really like the fact
            that everything is fairly straight forward in terms of doing the meth. As for Web Development
            I choose that one because over the summer I really got into the basics of HTML and wanted 
            to try it.</p>

        <p> Aside from school I also have quite a few hobbies that keep me entertained; one of my current
            hobbies is baking. Some of my favorite things to bake are tarts and cupcakes, however I think 
            my specialty would be cupcakes. I've been baking cupcakes since I was in 7th grade so by now I 
            think I have a pretty good understanding on how to make them.</p>

        <p> Another hobby that I have that I really enjoy but I hardly ever do is making stickers. Over the 
            years I made a couple drawings and turned them into stickers which is really fun but an expensive 
            hobby. It's also a hobby that takes up a lot of time so I rarely get to sit down, draw them, and make 
            them. </p>
