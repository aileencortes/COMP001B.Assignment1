        <p> What do you hope to learn in your CSS course?</p>
        <p> One thing that I'm hoping to learn in this class is how to use CSS without confusing myself. There are times
            where I found myself last semester wanting to use CSS but when I did I would get confused or over complicate 
            it for myself. So I'm hoping I get a broader understanding of CSS so I don't over complicate things.</p>

        <p> Another thing I hope to learn in this class is to become more familiarized with certain CSS vocabulary. I tend
            to forget the vocabulary; so when it comes to doing an assignment I may know how to do it but because I'm not 
            familiar with the vocabulary I tend to get lost. </p>

        <p> I also hope I learn to memorize certain CSS codes as well as html ones. Since I'm still fairly new to CSS and
            HTML I want to be able to learn the basics really good so I can really memorize it.</p>
